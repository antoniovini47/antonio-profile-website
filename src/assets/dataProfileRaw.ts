Although it wasn't in the development field, it was certainly where I had the greatest life lessons, especially in people management (we grew to over 30 employees simultaneously). It was structured the franchise and later completed a buyout to transition ownership of the business.",

          "I am a client of Júpiter Internet, and during an access to their platform, I noticed a security flaw that exposed access to the personal and business data of all their clients. Upon discovering this, I created a bot using Python to exploit the vulnerability and compile spreadsheets with all the information. I then prepared a detailed report and submitted it to the technical security manager. Since then, I have been studying the field more deeply and considering a career in cyber security.",
